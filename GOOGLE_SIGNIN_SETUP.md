Running the following steps will help you set up Google Sign-In in your Flutter application:

1. First, make sure you have the Google Cloud project set up and have enabled the Google Sign-In API.

2. Get your Google Cloud Project configuration:
   - Go to the Firebase Console
   - Add your Android and iOS apps
   - Download the google-services.json for Android
   - Download the GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS
   - Place these files in their respective platform folders

3. Add the required dependencies to your pubspec.yaml:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     firebase_auth: ^4.15.3
     google_sign_in: ^6.1.6
   ```

4. For Android:
   - Make sure your android/app/build.gradle.kts has the google-services plugin
   - Get your SHA-1 and SHA-256 certificates by running:
     ```
     cd android
     ./gradlew signingReport
     ```
   - Add these certificates to your Firebase project

5. For iOS:
   - Update your Info.plist with the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from GoogleService-Info.plist

6. Use the provided `GoogleSignInButton` widget in your login screen
   ```dart
   GoogleSignInButton(
     onSignInComplete: (success) {
       if (success) {
         // Navigate to home screen or perform other actions
       }
     },
   )
   ```

7. The AuthService class is ready to use for handling sign-in and sign-out operations.

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this setup?
